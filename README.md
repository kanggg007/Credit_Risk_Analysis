Based on the jupyter notebook:

balanced accuracy score is 77%
Precision: 0.99
Recall: 0.88




AdBoost Classifier

Based on the jupyter notebook:

balanced accuracy score is 93%
Precision: 0.99
Recall: 0.94



Summary:

Based on the classification report, we easily concluded that AdBoost Classifier is most proper model that we recommend as its recall rate is highest.
